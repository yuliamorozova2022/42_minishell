# Custom Shell in C

This project involves implementing a shell using the C programming language.

## Features

### âœ… Basic Functionality
- Displays a **prompt** when waiting for a new command.
- Maintains a **command history**.
- Searches and executes the correct program based on:
  - The `PATH` environment variable.
  - A relative or absolute path.

### âœ… Input Handling
- Properly handles **single quotes (`'`)** to prevent interpretation of metacharacters.
- Properly handles **double quotes (`"`)**, allowing `$` (dollar sign) expansion.
- Does **not** interpret:
  - Unclosed quotes.
  - Special characters such as backslash (`\`) or semicolon (`;`).

### âœ… Redirections
- **Input redirection (`<`)** â€“ Reads input from a file.
- **Output redirection (`>`)** â€“ Writes output to a file.
- **Append redirection (`>>`)** â€“ Writes output to a file in append mode.
- **Heredoc (`<<`)** â€“ Reads input until a given delimiter is encountered (without updating history).

### âœ… Pipes
- Supports the **pipe (`|`)** operator to connect the output of one command to the input of the next.

### âœ… Environment Variables
- Expands **environment variables** (`$VAR`).
- Expands **`$?`** to return the exit status of the last executed command.

### âœ… Signal Handling
- Uses **only one global variable** for signal handling.
- **Does not allow** signal handlers to modify main data structures.

### âœ… Keyboard Shortcuts (Interactive Mode)
| Shortcut | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `Ctrl + C` | Displays a new prompt on a new line. |
| `Ctrl + D` | Exits the shell. |
| `Ctrl + \` | Does nothing (default behavior). |

### âœ… Built-in Commands
The shell includes the following built-in commands:
- **`echo`** (with `-n` option)
- **`cd`** (only with a relative or absolute path)
- **`pwd`** (no options)
- **`export`** (no options)
- **`unset`** (no options)
- **`env`** (no options or arguments)
- **`exit`** (no options)

ðŸš€ **This shell provides a simplified Bash-like experience, handling essential command execution, redirections, pipes, and built-ins efficiently.**
